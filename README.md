## üß© Resolving Signup Errors

If you encounter **network errors** or **endless loading** during signup:

### Step 1: Update Frontend Environment

1. Go to `frontend/.env`  
2. Uncomment the first line (if commented out)
3. Restart the frontend:

```sh
cd frontend
npm start
```

### Step 2: Update API Base URL in Code

1. Open:  
   `frontend/src/redux/userRelated/userHandle.js`

2. Add after imports:

```js
const REACT_APP_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:5000";
```

3. Replace all instances of:

```js
process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL
```

with:

```js
REACT_APP_BASE_URL
```

4. Repeat this process in all files containing `"Handle"` in the filename, such as:
   - `teacherHandle.js`
   - `adminHandle.js`
   - Any `View` files that use a `deleteHandler` function
